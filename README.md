# Dorothy Music Player
> A minimalistic music player based on the use of plugins to customize it to your needs.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ABANDONED**: This is a experimental unfinished project that is not completely documented nor there is any plan to be finished. Feel free to experiment or extend it.
> The reason of the full stop of this project is due to the unpleasant experience with the `ncurses` package in the `lilim` TUI app and the `GStreamer` library in the `dorothy` daemon, bad typing decisions, a flawed design in the `buildin` plugin and bad behaviors and defaults in some methods in the `Channel` and `Orchestrator` classes.
